            <p>Avery Grambs is a high school student who sometimes lives in her car, and sometimes lives with her sister.
                She does not have a lot of money, but her grades are good - and her plan is to do well enough at school to
                win a scholarship, and then get away from her hometown.</p>
            <p>One day, she is called into the principal's office, and is met by a handsome billionaire's grandson, Grayson
                Hawthorne. Apparently, her name is in the Hawthorne will, and it is required that she is present at the
                reading of the will.</p>
            <p>
                As Avery arrives at the biggest mansion in America, she is surrounded by riddles, codes and puzzles.
                Who are the Hawthorne's? Why is Avery in their will? And what secrets can she uncover?
